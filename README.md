# Wine_Quality_Prediction
In this project, you will work with the Wine Quality dataset, which contains information about various chemical attributes of wine samples, such as acidity, pH, and alcohol content, along with their quality ratings. The goal is to build a machine learning model to predict the quality of wine based on these attributes.
